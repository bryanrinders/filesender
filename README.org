This repo contains a prototype, integrating [[https://postguard.eu][PostGuard]] (PG) into
Filesender. PG is an encryption service that is privacy- and
user-friendly. Using PG, uploaders nolonger have to manually distribute
the encryption password to the recipients. For more details see the
[[https://gitlab.com/postguard-filesender/thesis][thesis]] I wrote about this.

* Usage
The easiest way to get started and try out the newly added
functionality is with docker.

#+begin_src
  git clone https://gitlab.com/postguard-filesender/filesender.git --depth 1
  cd filesender
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d --build
#+end_src

Then open your browser and go to [[https://localhost:8443/filesender]].
